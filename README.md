# Traffic-Simulation Project for CS255
 
A traffic flow simulation based off of this project: https://github.com/gigahidjrikaaa/Traffic-Simulation

# Todo
- Random vehicle behavior / parameters
- Colision detection as a performance metric
- Average vehicle lifetime performance metric
- Multiple traffic flow control methods like four-way stop and four-way two lane intersections with a traffic light
